# Introduction

## Welcome to our Technical Interview Assessment

In this test, you'll be working with real employment data from Arbetsförmedlingen (the Swedish Public Employment Service). We've provided a repository containing a Rill Data project with a DuckDB database for you to explore and analyze.
Your task is to leverage your Business Intelligence skills to uncover meaningful insights from this dataset. You'll have the opportunity to demonstrate your proficiency with:

Data exploration and analysis
PowerBI visualization and reporting
Business insight identification and interpretation

The repository is set up with an example project, and you're encouraged to use your expertise to showcase how you would approach analyzing and visualizing this information in a business context.
Take your time to explore the data and create visualizations that you believe would provide valuable insights for stakeholders.

## Dataset Setup

### Database Installation
- You should have received a link to a DuckDB file containing a curated subset of Arbetsförmedlingen employment data
- If you haven't received the file, please contact us immediately
- Place the received file at `af-data/af.db` in your project directory
